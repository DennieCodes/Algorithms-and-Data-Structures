# Algorithms and Data Structures

Here is my collection of resources and links that I'm collecting as I study algorithms and data structures. Note: my field of study is Javascript so that's what I'll focus on but algorithms aren't exclusive to any particuarly coding language.

In this project, I am following the most excellent advice given in a super impactful reddit post: [The Definitive way on how to LeetCode properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgktuv/the_definitive_way_on_how_to_leetcode_properly/).

The advice is basically to take the list of patterns from: [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview) and then go to Leetcode and study solutions to problems utilizing those patterns. The idea is to study until you gain a deep level of understanding behind them. Only after you've studied a pattern and have a good mental framework and approach towards them should you then tackle problems.

Note: I use coding resources besides Leetcode and I am also studying data structures so I will add links and resources to those as well. **An account may be needed on some of these sites in order to access the problems and solutions on them.**
