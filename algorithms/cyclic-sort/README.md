### Cyclic Sort

The two pointers approach deals with problems that have a sorted array or Linked List and you need to find a set of elements that fulfill some kind of criteria. The set of elements can be any size subset of the array.

An example of a problem that suits this is when you have to search an array or Linked List for two elements that add up to a target value.
